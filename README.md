Morse Code Translator
This project is a Python-based Morse code translator that allows users to encode and decode messages to and from Morse code. It offers a simple command-line interface where users can input a sentence or a Morse code message, and the program will either convert it into its Morse code equivalent or decode it back into regular text.

Features
Encode Text to Morse Code: Convert regular text messages into their Morse code equivalents using a pre-defined dictionary of Morse code symbols.
Decode Morse Code to Text: Convert Morse code back into regular text.
Error Handling: The program handles invalid input gracefully, notifying the user if any characters or Morse code are not recognized.
Simple Command-Line Interface: Users can interact with the program by typing commands to either encode or decode messages.
Files
morse_code_logo.py: Contains introductory and exit messages displayed to the user.
morse_code_list_conversion.py: Includes a dictionary mapping between English characters and their corresponding Morse code symbols.
morse_code_translator.py: The main Python file, which contains the logic to encode and decode messages.
